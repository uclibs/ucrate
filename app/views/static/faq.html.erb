      How can I allow someone else to submit works on my behalf?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <%=t('hyrax.product_name') %> allows you to assign proxies, who will be able to submit new works on your behalf. They will retain access to modify these works until you remove their access. If you're logged in, you can manage your proxies from the “Current Proxies” section in your Dashboard, accessible via the top navigation bar.
    </blockquote>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <%=t('hyrax.product_name') %> allows you to create collections, to which you can add any works that you or others have submitted to <%=t('hyrax.product_name') %>. You can set a custom title, description, image, and some branding for your collections.

    </p>

    <p><a name="faq_1346" id="faq_1346"></a>
      How do I upload a preservation file?
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      You may upload a preservation file for your work during work creation or at any time afterward. Use the "Files" tab on the upload form when creating your work, or, while editing your work after creation. We recommend setting private access rights to preservation files, this will make it easier for users to know which they should download.
      <br><br>
      For more information, please see <%= link_to 'File Format Advice', format_advice_path %>.

    <p><a name="faq_7946" id="faq_7946"></a>
      May I publish, contribute, or otherwise distribute my content elsewhere?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Yes. When you submit content to <%=t('hyrax.product_name') %> you agree to a non-exclusive <%= link_to t('hyrax.deposit_agreement'), '/distribution_license_request' %> that grants UC the right to enhance metadata, to replicate the content for preservation, and to make the content available through computer interfaces. This license in no way prevents you from distributing your content through other channels.

    <p><a name="faq_1379" id="faq_1379"></a>
      What file formats should I use when uploading to <%=t('hyrax.product_name') %>?
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      File format is an important consideration when contributing your work to <%=t('hyrax.product_name') %>. The future usability of your content will depend on the file format you use. Because of this, we recommend uploading two files for each work: an access file and a preservation file.
      <br><br>
      An access file typically uses common formats that people are familiar with, usually compressed. It makes them easy to download and use. Examples of access formats are JPEG and MP3.
      <br><br>
      Preservation files should be the highest quality format available for your content, preferably uncompressed. They can be used to create new access files in the future, as formats change over time. Examples of preservation formats are TIFF and WAV. Uploading a preservation file will help guarantee your content will be easily used in the future.

    <p><a name="faq_7913" id="faq_7913"></a>
      What happens to my works if I delete them?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      If you have not requested a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for your work, you can withdraw any works you have submitted and they will be removed from <%=t('hyrax.product_name') %>. If you have requested a DOI, the work will be removed from <%=t('hyrax.product_name') %>, but a brief citation will be retained at our DOI provider's website that displays the work's citation information, and the reason for it's unavailability.
    </blockquote>



    <p><a name="faq_159" id="faq_159"></a>
      Where do I go if I want to consult with subject area specialists on content?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Access the <a href="https://libraries.uc.edu/research-teaching-support/subject-librarians.html">Subject Librarians directory</a> to find contact info for subject area specialists.

    <p><a name="faq_3456" id="faq_3456"></a>
      What's restricted data?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Restricted data is data that is private, confidential, classified as restricted by export control, or data that could be used to personally identify an individual. Some examples include social security numbers, financial account numbers, electronically stored bio-metric information, and data from research involving human subjects. Restricted Data is defined by <a href="https://www.uc.edu/content/dam/uc/infosec/docs/policies/Data_Governance_and_Classification_Policy_9.1.1.pdf">University of Cincinnati Policy 9.1.1 (Data Protection Policy)</a> and should be reviewed for additional information.

    <p><a name="faq_6543" id="faq_6543"></a>
      What’s the difference between proxies and editors?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Proxies are people you authorize who can create, edit, and delete works on your behalf. They can do anything you can do, so please exercise discretion when authorizing another person as a proxy. Your proxies may be managed from the "Current Proxies" section of your Dashboard.
      <br><br>
      Editors are individuals to whom you have granted the ability to view and make changes to a specific work. 
      <br><br>
      Editors are like proxies, but whereas proxies have all the powers of the person they represent, editors can only view and make changes to specific works.

      How do work access rights impact my DOIs?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      If you use <%=t('hyrax.product_name') %> to request a DOI, it will be either <i>public</i>, <i>reserved</i>, or <i>unavailable</i>.
      <br><br>
      <i>Public</i> DOIs are available for all <strong class="label label-success"><%=t('hyrax.visibility.open.text') %></strong> works, and work normally.
      <br><br>
      <i>Reserved</i> DOIs are granted to any <strong class="label label-success"><%=t('hyrax.visibility.open.text') %></strong>, <strong class="label label-info"><%=t('hyrax.visibility.authenticated.text', institution: institution_name) %></strong>, or <strong class="label label-danger"><%=t('hyrax.visibility.restricted.text') %></strong> works for which you request a DOI. A <i>reserved</i> DOI will not yet redirect to your work, but it will be available on the display page for your work for your reference. A <i>reserved</i> DOI will become <i>public</i> if you make your work <strong class="label label-success"><%=t('hyrax.visibility.open.text') %></strong> or if your <strong class="label label-warning"><%=t('hyrax.visibility.embargo.text') %></strong> expires.
      <br><br>
      <i>Unavailable</i> DOIs are maintained for works for which you have requested a DOI where you have deleted the work or where you have changed the access rights from <strong class="label label-success"><%=t('hyrax.visibility.open.text') %></strong> to <strong class="label label-warning"><%=t('hyrax.visibility.embargo.text') %></strong>, <strong class="label label-info"><%=t('hyrax.visibility.authenticated.text', institution: institution_name) %></strong>, or <strong class="label label-danger"><%=t('hyrax.visibility.restricted.text') %></strong>. A tombstone page will indicate that the work is not available because it was withdrawn from the author. If you change your work back to <strong class="label label-success"><%=t('hyrax.visibility.open.text') %></strong>, the DOI will change back to <i>public</i> status.
